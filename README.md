# Grocery-Single-Queue-Problem

A small grocery store has only one checkout counter. Customers arrive at this checkout counter at random random intervals between 1 to 8 minutes. Each possible value of inter arrival time has the same probability of occurrence. The service times vary from 1 to 6 minutes.

The goal is to analyze the system by simulating the arrival and service of 6 customers.
